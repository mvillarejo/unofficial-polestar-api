# unofficial-polestar-api

Unofficial async Python client and Home Assistant integration for Polestar gRPC APIs.

This project aims to bring you as much control as possible over your car. It uses the same APIs as the official mobile app and exposes most functionality.

> **Note on 12v battery impact:** This library communicates with Polestar's cloud servers, not the car directly. It polls the server every 10 minutes (default, configurable in HA) but it also keeps long lived streams open to the cloud to listen to changes (Battery, Location, Door status etc). It is unclear how much, and if this affects the 12v battery.  
If you have the opportunity, please monitor your battery voltage and report back.
## Supported Cars

This library implements the **C3** (Volvo Cars Cloud Connectivity) backend.
If you use this library (or the HA integration) please report back what works and what doesn't, for your model.
Contributions and testing from owners of other models are welcome and encouraged  
Not all features are available on all models. Look at the features list for some comments on different models.

## Usage

### Home Assistant

Requires [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed on your Home Assistant instance.

1. In HA, go to **HACS → ⋮ (top right) → Custom repositories**
2. Paste `kildahldev/unofficial-polestar-api` and select **Integration**
3. Click **Add**, then find **Unofficial Polestar** in HACS and click **Download**
4. Restart Home Assistant

Then add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Polestar**. Enter your Polestar ID email and password — the integration discovers the cars on your account and lets you **pick your vehicle from a list** and set the polling interval. Each config entry sets up one vehicle — to add more than one car, add the integration again and pick the other vehicle.

- **Secondary / guest accounts** (no vehicles listed): choose **"My vehicle is not listed"** and enter the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) manually.
- **Demo mode:** tick **Demo mode** on the first step and enter any VIN to get a fake vehicle with static data (no API connection needed).

See the [HA integration README](ha_integration_README.md) for setup, entities, services, and dashboard cards.

### As a library


    python  
    from polestar_api import PolestarApi  
      
    async with PolestarApi(email="you@example.com", password="...") as api:  
     vehicles = await api.get_vehicles() car = vehicles[0]  
     battery = await car.get_battery() print(f"{battery.charge_level}% — {battery.range_km} km")  
     location = await car.get_location() print(f"Lat {location.coordinate.latitude}, Lon {location.coordinate.longitude}") 

## Features

- **Battery** — charge level, range, charging status, power (with real-time streaming)
- **Location** — last known and last parked position (with real-time streaming)
- **Climate** — start/stop climatization with target temperature, seat and steering wheel heating
- **Climate timers** — view and manage scheduled parking climate timers
- **Locks** — lock, unlock, trunk unlock
- **Honk & flash** — flash lights or honk+flash
- **Windows** — open/close all windows
- **Exterior** — door, window, sunroof, hood, tailgate, and alarm status.
- **Charging** — target SOC, amp limit, charge timers, start/stop immediate charging *(amp limit appears to be unavailable on Polestar 4)*
- **Charge locations** — full CRUD for saved locations with per-location amp limits, min SOC, timers, departure times, and smart charging
- **Health** — service warnings, fluid levels, tyre pressures (kPa), all exterior light warnings, 12V battery *(Tyre pressure is unavailable on Polestar 2 as it does not have TPMS)*
- **Availability** — vehicle online status with unavailable reason
- **Weather** — temperature at car location
- **OTA** — software update info, scheduling, install now, cancel *(Appears to be unavailable on Polestar 4)*
- **Pre-cleaning** — air quality status (PM2.5, AQI) and start/stop cabin pre-cleaning *(Appears to be unavailable on Polestar 4)*

For the full API reference with all methods, models, and enums, see the [docs](https://kildahldev.github.io/unofficial-polestar-api/).

## FAQ

**The charging switch doesnt work?**
It uses the same `StartOverride`/`StopOverrideChargeTimer` calls as the official app, which only override an *active* charge schedule. If no schedule is active (the car is charging freely),
there's nothing to override, so the switch has no effect. I have yet to find an API to directly start/stop a charge session.
The only ways to stop a free charge is to set a charge schedule that excludes the current time, or to set the target SOC lower than the current SOC.
